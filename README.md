Converter of Markdown to PDF.

Why another Markdown to PDF converter?
Because I want to feed root Markdown file to the application and get
complete PDF with all subpages that linked in root file. I tried to find
such ready tool, but my search was unsuccessful.

As Markdown is not very strickt there are possible variations on rendering
of your files. If you will see that this application renders something wrong
(possible issue) you are welcome to fill the issue here on GitHub.
Please send me part of wrong rendered Markdown, what you got (PDF),
and what you expected to see (link to something that rendered right in
your opinion).

# Status

Alpha version is ready. Surely, there possible issues in the application.
But we don't afraid of bugs. Just post the issue here, and I will fix it
as soon as possible.
